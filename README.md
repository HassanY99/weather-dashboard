# Weather Dashbaord

# Description

This homework assignment was all about the combine use of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create a Weather Dashboard application. In this assignment we were asked to create this application from scratch. In this we were asked to use our knowledge about the use of getting API's to work, local storage and other skills that were taught in the last week.
